# STA304_Final_Project
The STA304 Final Project: predict the likelihood of food shortage in the near future based on the World Bank Dataset on The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020.

This repository is created by Yubing Xia (Student Number 1005063244). contains codes for fitting the logistic regression model based on the World Bank data. The purpose of this study is to create a model and to predict the impending probabilities of food shortage in the upcoming future.

The dataset used is *Predicting Food Crises 2020* provided by the World Bank. Before importing into R for manipulation, variable *p_stable_food* was renamed to *Pstable_food* to avoid double hyphen occurrance.
